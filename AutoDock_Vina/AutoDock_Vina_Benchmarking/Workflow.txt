(This is with the exception of 4S0V, as that was a separate test case, which was also used for learning how to use AutoDock)

1. Pull ligand and receptor from benchmark set. Receptor found in /data/project/thymelab/running_Rosetta/ari_work/REU_shared_space/benchmark/files/all/(name)/ as (name).pdb. Ligand found in /data/project/thymelab/running_Rosetta/ari_work/REU_shared_space/benchmark/files/ as (name)-lig.pdb.
2. Move ligand and receptor to new folder with the receptor name in. Found on PC under "\Users\Ari\Box Sync\Thyme Lab\AutoDock Vina Benchmarking\(name)"
3. Use OpenBabel GUI to make PDBQT files of receptor and ligand (PDB -> PDBQT). Rename ligand to "ligand.pdbqt" and receptor to "receptor.pdbqt". In conversion options, select the following:

"Preserve atom incides from input file"
"Preserve hydrogens"
"Preserve atom names"

Exclusively for the receptor, also select "Output as rigid molecule". Receptor MUST be rigid and ligand CAN NOT be rigid.

4. Open the ligand PDB and note coordinates of a central atom for the AutoDock run (needed to figure out where autoDock should be trying to place the ligand).

5. Creage config args file as "args.txt". Config file contains parameters specific to the run. Example as follows:

=============================================================================================
receptor =  "\Users\Ari\Box Sync\Thyme Lab\AutoDock Vina Benchmarking\(name)\receptor.pdbqt"
ligand = "\Users\Ari\Box Sync\Thyme Lab\AutoDock Vina Benchmarking\(name)\ligand.pdbqt" 

center_x =  -8
center_y =  -6
center_z = 55

size_x = 20
size_y = 20
size_z = 20

out = "\Users\Ari\Box Sync\Thyme Lab\AutoDock Vina Benchmarking\(name)\output.pdbqt"
==============================================================================================

Can likely keep the same value for size_* as 20, since that seems to provide a large enough volume for investigating.

6. Run AutoDock Vina. On my computer, run in Windows CMD as:
"\Program Files (x86)\The Scripps Research Institute\Vina\vina.exe" --config "\Users\Ari\Box Sync\Thyme Lab\AutoDock Vina Benchmarking\(name)\args.txt"
