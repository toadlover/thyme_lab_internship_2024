#Using Singularity version 3.5.2
#Loaded Singularity from existing module using:
module load Singularity/3.5.2-GCC-5.4.0-2.26 

#Singularity image file of alphafold3 was generated from pre-built instructions from UAB Research Computing
#Built image as:
singularity pull alphafold3.sif docker://gitlab.rc.uab.edu:4567/rc-data-science/community-containers/alphafold3/alphafold3:f0bc27f5

#basic execution of alphafold from image, calling run_alphafold.py script to utilize
singularity exec --nv alphafold3.sif python3 /app/alphafold/run_alphafold.py --help

#Alphafold3 needs to be called with GPUs to function

#helpful link to running/installing alphafold

#link to test case for basic example:
https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3/blob/main/README.md#installation-and-running-your-first-prediction

#to utilize alphafold, the following is needed:
#Residue sequence of each protein chain
#SMILES string of native ligand
