This is from running the benchmarking pipeline on the DUD-E ligand set with the Rosetta LigandDiscoverySearch protocol.
For each system from DUD-E, motifs that were derived from homologous PDB systems (determined via BLAST) were removed from the input motifs library before running the search.
The current data from the motifs method is from benchmark run 112.
